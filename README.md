## Run the Code
The client is implemented in Dart/Flutter. The server (optional) is implemented in Python with WebSockets. Further details are available in the `README` files located in the [`client/`](client) and [`server/`](server) directories.


## Data
There are 12 card decks: Cars, Airplanes and Rockets are located in [`client/assets/carddecks/`](client/assets/carddecks), and Animals, Planetary Systems, Dinosaurs, Skyscrapers, Tanks, World Football Stars, World Tennis Stars, Extreme Sports and Mega Cities are located in [`server/data/`](server/data). A card deck is stored in a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "number",
  "name": "string",
  "thumbnailPath": "string",
  "backgroundPath": "string",
  "characteristics": [
    {
      "measurementType": "string",  // e.g., "mass", "velocity"
      "isHigherBetter": "boolean",
      "label": "string"  // e.g., "Weight", "Speed"
    }
  ],
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": "number",
      "name": "string",
      "subtitle": "string",
      "imagePath": "string",
      "imageAttr": "string",
      "imageLic": "string",
      "values": ["number"]  // e.g., [1.23, 4.56]
    }
  ]
}
```

To add a new card deck, create a new JSON file in the appropriate directory and add the card deck to the list of card decks in [`client/assets/carddecks/localCardDecks.json`](client/assets/carddecks/localCardDecks.json) or [`server/data/serverCardDecks.json`](server/data/serverCardDecks.json). Alternatively, a card deck can be created in the app using the card deck editor GUI or by importing a JSON file. 

Image paths can be either URLs or local paths. Local images should be placed in [`client/assets/images/<YourCardDeckName>/`](client/assets/images) and the new directory should be added to the list of assets in [`client/pubspec.yaml`](client/pubspec.yaml).
